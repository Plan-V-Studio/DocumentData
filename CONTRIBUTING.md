# Contribution Statement

## Overview

The DocumentData project is a project that allows developers to transform their data models into persistent data files.

### How dose DocumentData work?

DocumentData works with [Swift Macro](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/macros), which is the best way to omit repetitive and fixed code.

### Commit your code.

When you write your code, make sure your code is concise and easy to understand. Plan-V Studio will check your code before your code merge to the main branch, to save unnecessary waiting time, write comments for code that you feel needs to be explained.

### Test your code before creating the pull request.

Before you create the pull request, please make sure your code is well tested, Plan-V Studio will test your code before merge your branch, if the code meet some issues, we will let you know.

You can attach unit test in `Tests/DocumentDataTest/DocumentDataTests.swift` file, or create a new unit test file. 

### Explain everything in your pull request.

When you create a pull request, describe everything you contribute in detail, and Plan-V Studio will check that the code matches your description before merge the branch. You can use serval section to explain your contribution, like New Feature, Bug Fixes, etc.

## Contribute Code Security

Before you submit your pull request, make sure there are no unsafe operations in your code. Insecure code can lead to unexpected operational results or cause serious security problems. 

Plan-V Studio will check the security of the code before merging branches to ensure that all operations can be performed safely.
